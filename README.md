## I've been thinking about...
*How might the integration of AR, AI, and IoT technologies in HMD platforms potentially open up new avenues for improving the home living experience of Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals?*

## Project Introduction (Why do I choose this topic?)
As technology rapidly evolves, voice-command-based smart assistants are becoming integral to our daily lives. However, this advancement overlooks the needs of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community, creating a technological gap in current systems. To address this technological oversight, this study develops a Mixed-Reality (MR) application that integrates Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to fill the gaps in safety, communication, and accessibility for DHH individuals at home.

## Research Methodologies 
![image](https://github.com/NarrowSpace/Quiet-Interaction-For-Deaf-and-Hard-of-Hearing-Community/assets/105491905/945a1f3a-695a-4d8d-884f-187f5034954d)

+ **Literature Review:**
Gain insights into the daily challenges that DHH individuals encounter at home, as well as the advantages and limitations of current solutions.

+ **Online Survey with DHH Individuals:**
A more detailed understanding of their specific challenges and needs.

## Required Package
### Embedded
+ [Meta Interaction SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/meta-xr-interaction-sdk-264559)

# Important Note

As this project involves communication between hardware and APIs, it requires a somewhat complex setup and a basic understanding of Raspberry Pi.
If you're interested in experimenting with the application, please ensure you have the following setup:

## RaspberryPi Setup
1. Set up your **Zigbee Dongle** and **MQTT broker** ([you can refer to this tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/how-to-install-mosquitto-broker-on-raspberry-pi/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efmsed9Aj-o&t=605s))) on your Raspberry Pi, and enter your API keys for Azure Speech Service (a free tier is available).
2. Run the Python scripts on Raspberry Pi, remember to change the IP address and note the port numbers (*feel free to change it*) used in these scripts.
   *For the speech services script, you can choose between Livecaption.py and Translation.py. There's no need to run both.*

## Unity Setup
### After downloading the project:

1. Import FlatKit & 3D WebView for Android
2. Enter your Azure Speech key and Live Caption port in the Inspector:

## Support
Given the complexity of the setup, if you encounter any issues during setup or testing, please do not hesitate to contact me. Let's work together to build a more accessible home living environment for the DHH community.
